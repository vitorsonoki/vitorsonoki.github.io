# Contact me

Wanna get in touch with me? Send me an email at `vitorsonoki_NOSP4M_.0a04_NOSP4M_@yahoo.com` (remove any `_NOSP4M_` from the address) and let's get in touch!

You can also send me [encrypted email](https://gnupg.org/) with my PGP key: `50AADBDE09EF8744BA333E607A4E71A737168122`. The public key is also available [here in this website in plain text](/static/key.txt).

I am a big fan of *decentralized communication platforms*, and I'm especially fond of the [XMPP protocol](https://xmpp.org/), formerly known as Jabber. It's instant messaging a-la Signal, except that's decentralized, and anyone can host a node. Get in touch with me at `vesonoki _AT_ yax.im` (place the `@` where appropriate) from your favorite client. Don't have one? Try the online one from [ConverseJS](https://conversejs.org/fullscreen.html).

Additionally, reach out to me on [Github](https://github.com/vitorsonoki) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-sonoki-064375348/).

I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
