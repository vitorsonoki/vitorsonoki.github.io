# Privacy Policy

This page does not collect any information from you or your browser, neither does it sets or retrieves any information via the usage of cookies. That is why you don't see any of those annoying "Cookie Notice" banners when browsing it: none are used here, you can check it yourself.

Occasionally, external content from sources other than this site may be linked or otherwise included in determined pages in this site, like it's case with images or video. In those cases, such content is served under the privacy policies of such external sources, independent of this privacy policy.

The site is hosted on [Github.com](https://github.com)'s *Pages* platform, and thus may be subject to their own data collection policy, which might include things like your IP address. Please consult [Github's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) for more information.
