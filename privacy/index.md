# Privacy Policy

First and foremost: *thank you* for taking the time to read this specific page in this website! This means that, like me, you're also rightly concerned about your privacy online and happens to your data.

This page *does not collect any information* from you or your browser, neither does it set or retrieve any information via the usage of cookies. That is why you don't see any of those annoying "Cookie Notice" banners when browsing it; none are used here, you can check it yourself. This includes elements such as fonts and local images - they are all served locally, no CDNs, no strings attached.

Occasionally, external content from sources other than this site may be linked or otherwise included in specific pages in this site, like it's case with some images or video. In those cases, such content is served under the privacy policies of such external sources, independent of this privacy policy.

Online privacy is a big thing for me. If you're interesting in learning more about it or discussing it with me, feel free to [reach out to me](/contact). I'd love to have a chat about it!

## Technologies powering this site

Curious as to how this site is developed? It's actually quite simple.

This site is completely static, meaning all content is written by me by hand, then converted into the HTML through my [sitegen](https://github.com/raspibrasil/sitegen) script. I then upload the final HTML files to my servers, which in turn display them directly. No rendering, no databases, no security problems!

In the backstage, this site is hosted on [Github.com](https://github.com)'s *Pages* platform, and thus may be subject to their own data collection policy, which might include things like your IP address. Note that this data *never* reaches me, and is collected exclusively by Github instead, without any degree of my control. Please consult [Github's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) for more information on the data they collect.
