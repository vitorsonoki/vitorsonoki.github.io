# Articles and essays written by Vitor Sonoki

I love writing, and every now and then I write a new essay or long-form article, be it about my philosophy, Free Software, Online Security, or many other topics. What better place to read them - ad and distraction-free and lightweight - than in my own site?

Carefully check the date of publication of these essays, especially those concerning news events or technology at a specific period of time. Some of them may have "aged" a little less gracefully `;)`

All opinions in these essays are my own and do not reflect in any form the opinion of my former or current employer.

 - Currently no essays published... yet `;)`
