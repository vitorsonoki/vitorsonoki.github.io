# Ten years working in the Olympics

Outline:

 - I first started working in the Olympics business on Feb 3rd 2014.
 - Ten years and 3 Olympiads later, here's me looking forward to ten more!

Today, February 3rd 2024, marks my 10th anniversary of working in the Olympic games.

Having worked so many events and for so many years now, it would be easy to pass such a milestone in the midst of the rush to deliver [Paris 2024](https://www.paris2024.org), currently speeding down the road at 174 days to go. But over the past weeks, I had been watching as the last digit of the year turned from 3 to 4 to match the same one as the year I had started - 2014.

Back when 2014 started, I was still working a "traditional," non-event job at the [Estaleiro Enseada](/curriculum/enseada). Due to a change in my job's assignments, I had recently started to manage a weekly commute between home at Rio de Janeiro and the shipbuilding operations site at São Roque, four hours north across the country by plane in the countryside of the state of Bahia. Whereas Rio had been cozy and familiar, São Roque was the very opposite; a tiny fishing village turning company town with the heavy investments from Enseada and their client Petrobrás.

February 3rd, 2014, the first Monday of that February, marked that big day. I didn't know how much to expect working at an "Olympic-level" project, and frankly no welcoming session could be large enough to explain what would be coming up for the incredible ride of the next two and a half years when I worked in the Games of the XXXI Olympiad, better known as [Rio 2016](/curriculum/rio2016). Just the week before, I had been finishing my job at São Roque, handing over my operations and signing off on my contract with Enseada. Days later, I was back at the state of Rio, facing a façade dressed from head to toe with Olympic colors.

To say that the environment change is drastic is a severe understatement. There are so many striking differences between the Olympics delivery environment and what's internally referred to as the "business as usual" mode of operations. It starts from your very onboarding - the congratulations you get for being aboard to deliver the largest single event on earth, the firing up on all the challenges and how we will overcome them, and the visitation to Olympics-related facilities to really see how this is all, indeed, real. You are left in pure awe after the first few days, and that's a great feeling. And then reality starts settling in again a few weeks later.

You realize that the scope of your work is growing - not something unusual per se, but at this speed it's a little concerning. What is this new project that was handed over to me? Why didn't anyone think about this other thing, and who's going to do it now? Isn't this supposed to be the responsibility of those other guys there? Step by step, question by question, the once clear Olympics picture becomes murkier and suddenly you start to get overwhelmed by the lack of certainty.
