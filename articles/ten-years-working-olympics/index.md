# Ten years working in the Olympics

Outline:

 - I first started working in the Olympics business on Feb 3rd 2014.
 - Ten years and 3 Olympiads later, here's me looking forward to ten more!

Today, February 3rd 2024, marks my 10th anniversary of working in the Olympic games.

Having worked so many events and for so many years now, it would be easy to pass such a milestone in the midst of the rush to deliver [Paris 2024](https://www.paris2024.org), currently speeding down the road at 174 days to go. But over the past weeks, I had been watching as the last digit of the year turned from 3 to 4 to match the same one as the year I had started - 2014.
