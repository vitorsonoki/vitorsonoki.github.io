# Ten years working in the Olympics

Outline:

 - I first started working in the Olympics business on Feb 3rd 2014.
 - Ten years and 3 Olympiads later, here's me looking forward to ten more!

Today, February 3rd 2024, marks my 10th anniversary of working in the Olympic games.

Having worked so many events and for so many years now, it would be easy to pass such a milestone in the midst of the rush to deliver [Paris 2024](https://www.paris2024.org), currently speeding down the road at 174 days to go. But over the past weeks, I had been watching as the last digit of the year turned from 3 to 4 to match the same one as the year I had started - 2014.

Back when 2014 started, I was still working a "traditional," non-event job at the [Estaleiro Enseada](/curriculum/enseada). Due to a change in my job's assignments, I had recently started to manage a weekly commute between home at Rio de Janeiro and the shipbuilding operations site at São Roque, four hours north across the country by plane in the countryside of the state of Bahia. Whereas Rio had been cozy and familiar, São Roque was the very opposite; a tiny fishing village turning company town with the heavy investments from Enseada and their client Petrobrás.

February 3rd, 2014, the first Monday of that February, marked that big day. I didn't know how much to expect working at an "Olympic-level" project, and frankly no welcoming session could be large enough to explain what would be coming up for the next two and a half years that I worked in Rio 2016.
