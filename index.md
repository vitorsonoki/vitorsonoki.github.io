# Welcome!

My name is Vitor and I'm a Brazilian Technologist with a special passion for [Free and Open Source Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). A curious tinkerer and creator by nature, I'm always looking to supply solutions where they are needed, and to improve on the existing ones.

I currently lead IT and Telecom project management, having delivered several projects of sizes big and small around the globe along [my career](/curriculum). In my spare time, I create websites and online platforms, and develop other Free and Open Source Software tools to give back to this amazing community.

I'm also a freelance writer publishing articles about computing and Free Software in my [Raspberry Pi Brasil](https://www.raspberrypibrasil.com) website, and about personal finance and investing in [Pinguim Investidor](https://pinguiminvestidor.com). My first book [*RICAmente*](https://www.amazon.com/RICAmente-Virando-jogo-financeiro-Portuguese-ebook/dp/B088FXT166), published May 2020, explains how to turn your life's finances around and walk towards your financial independence.

Learning languages (both human and programming ones) is another one of my passions. Currently, I'm fluent in three (English, Portuguese and Japanese), and I'm planning to learn at least two more in the coming years.

Have a look at [my personal projects](/projects) to find out more. Interested in taking part? [Get in touch with me!](/contact)
